Change, illness, injury or career and lifestyle changes are common causes of stress, however, its the effects of stress like pressure and tensions, that we feel in response to the little everyday hassles, like rush hour traffic, waiting in line, and too many emails that do the most damage.</p>
            <p>Stress is the body and mind response to any pressure that disrupts its normal balance. It occurs when the perception of events does not meet our expectations and we are unable to manage our reaction. As a response, stress expresses itself as a resistance, tension, strains or frustration, that throws off our physiological and psychological equilibrium, keeping us out of sync. If our equilibrium is disturbed for long, the stress cab become disabling and create numerous health problems.</p>
            <p>Stress and effects of stress are often misunderstood. We look at outside events as the source of stress, but in fact stress is really caused by our emotional reactions to events.
