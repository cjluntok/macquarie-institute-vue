        <h4>The HeartMath Inner Balance:</h4>
        <p>Trainer is an innovative approach to improving wellness through training, education and self-monitoring. HeartMath Inner Balance shows you your heart rhythm pattern (HRV) and a breathing pacer to go along with your heart rhythms, training you how to change your heart rhythm pattern to support a healthier, more consistently coherent mind and physiology. The HeartMath Inner Balance Trainer works with both IOS and Android smartphones. Internal state is detected via a simple pulse earpiece or finger sensor and heart rhythm data is fed into the app. Heart rhythm patterns are an excellent reflection of our inner state. We can use the Inner Balance to learn how to shift into a state of balance, self-reliance and renewing positive feelings, such as appreciation and compassion. Another way to say it is that the Inner Balance technology analyses and displays our heart rhythm, measured by Heart Rate Variability (HRV), which indicates how emotional states are affecting our nervous system. HRV is studied by leading medical researchers all around the globe but it has been further utilised and studied in depth at the HeartMath Institute. With years of achieving results directly their work now offers this technology giving a window into the quality of communication between the heart and brain, which directly impacts how we feel and perform.</p>

        <h4>The Inner Balance technology:</h4>
        <p>it trains us to self-generate a highly efficient physiological state called HRV coherence or heart coherence, which helps us increase emotional composure and clearer reasoning. Now used and promoted by leading health professionals around the world and in Australia, the HeartMath inner coherence training has been associated with many health and performance benefits. A few minutes of daily coherence practice has been shown to reduce and prevent the negative effects of stress, relating to overwhelm, fatigue and exhaustion, sleep disruption, anxiety and burnout. HeartMath as a pioneer in HRV research and self-regulation training for over 25 years have been published in more than 250 independent peer-reviewed studies describing HeartMath skills, tools, methodologies (and the technologies that support learning and practicing them).</p>
        

        <h4>The emWave Pro Program:</h4>
        <p>it is designed for Mac, pad, tablet and pc computer use. For anyone but also in a clinical setting due to the powerful multi-user management software. Its patented heart rhythm monitor will help you transform stress and anxiety into vibrant energy. The Emwave Pro is much more than a heart monitor, as this revolutionary technology guides you how to achieve higher, more creative energy levels, less stress and optimal health. EmWave technology is an innovative approach to improving wellness and facilitating personal growth based on learning to change your heart rhythm pattern to create a more together, smoother and coherent pattern; a scientifically measurable state characterized by increased order and harmony in our psychological, physiological mind-body processes.</p>

        <h4>The emWave2 is a portable:</h4>
        <p>it is dedicated pocket-sized unit and very convenient way to reduce stress, balance emotions and increase performance using the HeartMath concepts, tools and skills. Used just a few minutes a day, this simple-to-use technology helps you transforms feelings and trains your physiology to respond differently to stress, anger and anxiety. The EmWave2 is often selected over the Inner Balance trainer app (for smartphone) because it leaves your phone free and the EmWave2 device can be shared with others, something we are less inclined to do with our main smartphone.</p>
        <p>Using a pulse sensor plugged into your emWave2 or emWave Pro or your smartphone the HeartMath software collects pulse data and translates coherence information into light patterns and user-friendly graphics displayed on the display screen. emWave2 or emWave Pro and Inner Balance App help you create a coherent state through the above-mentioned coherence techniques, as well as interesting and enjoyable interactive exercises and games. Using HeartMath technologies assists in developing inner resilience, increasing energy, and promoting focus, mental clarity and emotional balance.</p>

        <h4>Special packages available:</h4>
        <p>The emWave Pro Health Professional Packages are mainly used by therapists, coaches, counsellors and mentors for clients. The emWave Pro Health Professional Packages are very popular with health professionals of almost every discipline, modality and specialty.
